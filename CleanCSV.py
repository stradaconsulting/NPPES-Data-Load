# This script filters a csv file by the value in a specified column.
# The output file does not quote columns and uses the pipe delimiter.
# Command line as follows:
# python CleanCSV.py <input file name> <output file name> <col number> <filter value>
# The purpose of this script is to change the input CSV file into a pipe-delimited file. The
# issue is that the data may contain pipe characters and this script does not take that into 
# account. There are also issues with the unknown characters due to an unknown character set 
# provided  in the file.  All character sets were tested and they all threw errors. Instead 
# the open() command has an ignore errors parameter passed and this works fine. The character
# set issue will be addressed later.

# This is a general purpose file and the interim file that gets creatd with the stripped
# piped characters will be named temp_transformed.csv
